# Using Remix

We have decided to deprecate our Remix fork in favor of a new plugin we are currently developing. This plugin will enable you to develop your contracts directly on [the official Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) by simply loading the fhEVM plugin.

To use it:

1. Go to the "Plugin Manager" page
2. Click on "Connect to a Local Plugin"
3. Fill the name with "Zama" and the "Url" with "https://remix.zama.ai/"
4. Keep "Iframe" and "Side panel" and validate
